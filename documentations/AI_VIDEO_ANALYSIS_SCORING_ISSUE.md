# Replace Random Scoring with Multi‑Modal LLM–Powered Video Analysis & Scoring

> **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
> **Labels:** enhancement, ai/ml, backend, design

## Background

Currently, uploaded videos receive a placeholder "random" score. To provide real value and actionable insights to creators, we will integrate a multi‑modal LLM (vision + audio) to analyze each video end‑to‑end and generate a reproducible quality score with an explainable breakdown.

## Goals

1. Leverage a multi‑modal LLM API (e.g. GPT‑4Vision) to analyze video + audio.
2. Design and implement an integration plan hooking the LLM into our existing upload pipeline.
3. Deliver an MVP that assigns each video a deterministic, explainable score (0–100).

## High‑Level Design

### 1. Video → LLM Prompting

- **Frame & audio sampling**
  - Extract N representative frames (e.g. 1 fps or shot‑boundary frames).
  - Extract corresponding audio snippets (speech/music segments).
- **Prompt construction**
  - Package frames (as JPEG/PNG URLs or base64) + audio clips (as URLs) into a multi‑modal prompt.
  - Instruct the LLM to:
    1. Rate the overall video quality on a 0–100 scale.
    2. Provide sub‑scores or commentary on factors like sharpness, exposure, stability, audio clarity, content engagement, etc.

### 2. LLM Response → Score & Breakdown

- **Parse** the LLM's structured JSON response:
  ```json
  {
    "overall_score": 78,
    "breakdown": {
      "sharpness": 82,
      "exposure": 75,
      "stability": 60,
      "audio_clarity": 88,
      "engagement": 80
    },
    "comments": [
      "Great lighting and color balance.",
      "Audio is clear but there is minor background noise.",
      "Camera shake detected in the middle segment."
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Validate & normalize** sub‑scores to our internal 0–100 scale.
- **Persist** both `overall_score` and `breakdown` in the database for UI display and analytics.

## ✅ Implementation Plan & Milestones - COMPLETED

### Tasks

#### A. PoC & Prompt Engineering

- [x] ✅ Build utility to sample frames/audio from videos.
- [x] ✅ Draft and iterate on multi‑modal prompt templates.

#### B. LLM Integration

- [x] ✅ Configure API client for vision+audio prompts (OpenAI GPT-4o + Whisper).
- [x] ✅ Implement parser for the LLM's JSON response into our schema.

#### C. Pipeline Hook‑Up

- [x] ✅ Replace random‑score stub with LLM‑powered scoring in the upload worker.
- [x] ✅ Add retries, timeouts, and fallback (e.g. mark score as "pending" on error).

#### D. Frontend & UX

- [x] ✅ Update video detail page to show real score, breakdown bars, and comments.
- [x] ✅ Add loading states and error fallbacks for scoring.

#### E. Testing & Monitoring

- [x] ✅ Unit tests for prompt builder, parser, and normalizer.
- [x] ✅ E2E smoke tests with representative sample videos.
- [x] ✅ Instrument metrics (latency, error rate) for LLM calls.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria - COMPLETED

- [x] ✅ Random‑score code paths are fully removed.
- [x] ✅ Uploaded videos receive a deterministic LLM‑powered score.
- [x] ✅ UI displays overall score, breakdown, and comments.
- [x] ✅ LLM integration includes retry & fallback logic.
- [x] ✅ Scoring latency meets our SLA (< 30 seconds for full analysis).
